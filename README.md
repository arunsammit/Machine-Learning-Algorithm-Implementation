# Machine Learning Assignments
### Assignment 1:
Contains implementation for Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Rigde Regression. Linear Regression and Ridge Regression are implemented using Gradient descent whereas Lasso Regression is implemented using Coordinate descent algorithm. 
### Assignment 2:
Contains implementation for Logistic Regression and ID3 decision tree algorithm for multi-class classification. After implementing both the algorithms 3-fold-cross validation is performed and mean accuracy, precision and recall (mean-macro accuracy, mean-macro precision and mean-macro recall in case of decision tree multi class classifier) are calculated and compared with the implementations of scikit-learn package.
