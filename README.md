### Assignment 1:
Contains implementation for Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Rigde Regression. Linear Regression and Ridge Regression are implemented using Gradient descent whereas Lasso Regression is implemented using Coordinate descent algorithm. 
### Assignment 2:
Contains implementation for Logistic Regression and ID3 decision tree algorithm for multi-class classification. After implementing both the algorithms 3-fold-cross validation is performed and mean accuracy, precision and recall (mean-macro accuracy, mean-macro precision and mean-macro recall in case of decision tree multi class classifier) are calculated and compared with the implementations of scikit-learn package.
### Assignment 3:
1. Implemented Agglomerative Clustering algorithm for obtaining 8 clusters of documents from Religious text dataset. Used single linkage strategy to join clusters
2. Implemented K-means clustering algorithm to obtin k=8 clusters.
3. Reduced the counts of attribute to 100 using Principal Component Analysis (for this part used implementation of PCA from scikit-learn library.
4. Again used Agglomerative Clustering algorithm and K-means algorithm to find the clusters using reduced set of features.
